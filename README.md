## Notes

* The first challenge was getting used to XCode. For example, I would click on every folder to find the Controller and/or Main Board.. until I finally got more familiar.
* I  tried creating a Settings Page that would adjust the Tip Percentage Slider Default, Min, and Max Values; with the help of the UIPickerView. However, I implemented too many (personally) new concepts, making it a bit more challenging to incorporate them together. Nevertheless, looking forward to figuring it out.
